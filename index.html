	<h4>Why Secondhand?</h4>

<p style='color: pink; font-size: 18px;'>As environmental concerns grow, many consumers are left feeling stuck between a rock and a hard place: the desire for new products and the guilt of environmental disasters caused by industrialism. While consumers are heavily influenced to buy new through marketing tactics, some consumers are taking things into their own hands by shopping secondhand, reusing, and refurbishing old products. These small actions extend the life cycle of the products and ultimately create less waste. Shopping secondhand also sends a message to industry heads that consumers priorities are changing. Why not be part of the movement?
