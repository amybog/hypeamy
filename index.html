      <h4>Why Secondhand?</h4>

<p style="text-align: center;">As environmental concerns grow, many consumers are left feeling stuck between a rock and a hard place: the desire for new products and the guilt of environmental disasters caused by industrialism. While consumers are heavily influenced to buy new through marketing tactics, some consumers are taking things into their own hands by shopping secondhand, reusing, and refurbishing old products. These small actions extend the life cycle of the products and ultimately create less waste. While consumer waste is only a fraction of the output, in 2021 the Green Business Bureau found that global textile consumption has risen to 62 million tons of apparel per year. We can use our power as consumers to gradually reduce textile waste. Additionally, shopping secondhand sends a message to industry heads that consumer priorities are changing. Why not be part of the movement?</p>

	<h5>Describing my Style</h5>

          <p style="text-align: center;">Trends come and go, but having your own style is timeless. Over the years, my style has been influenced by minimalism, flattering silouettes, and the influx of unisex lines. While most of my items are tagged womenswear, I believe <em>anyone</em> is able to rock them. If the exact measurements of the item aren't listed in its' description, feel free to ask for measurements via <a href="https://www.depop.com/hypeamy/">Depop</a> messages. I can't wait to see how you style my garments! </p>
